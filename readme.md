Solitaire twenty zero (forty eight)

Cards on Places arranged on a linked Grid

## Introduction

Within puzzle games, there's a genre of sliding block puzzles. Within that, there's a subgenre that started with Threes!, quickly followed by 1024 and 2048.

Threes! is the most refined and has, IMHO, the better gameplay. 1024 and 2048 seem
a little rough, and have games that can score highly just by using a repeative sequence
of keystrokes.

All of them, though, have a slightly annoying and confusing game mechanic whereby sliding
a tile in one direction also slides all the other tiles in the grid. It's confusing
for a beginner and hard to keep track of, indicators of a bad gameplay smell.

# TODO

- refactor Button classes
- memory leaks (there may be one)
- score bling (too distracting)
