## Introduction

Within puzzle games, there's a genre of sliding block puzzles. Within that, there's a subgenre that started with Threes!, quickly followed by 1024 and 2048.

Threes! is the most refined and has, IMHO, the better gameplay. 1024 and 2048 seem a little rough, and have games that can score highly just by using a repeative sequence of keystrokes.
